    Create a function that returns True if its arguments are permutations of each other.

    Next, define some testable properties for this function,
    and use a number of well-chosen lists to test isPermutation.
    You may assume that your input lists do not contain duplicates.
    What does this mean for your testing procedure?

    Provide an ordered list of properties by strength using the weakear and stronger definitions.
    Can you automate the test process? Use the techniques presented in this week's lecture. Also use QuickCheck.

    The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) was designed to facility international money transfer,

    iban :: String -> Bool

    that implements this validation procedure.

    Next, test your implementation using some suitable list of examples.

    Note It is not enough to test only with correct examples. You should invent a way to test with incorrect examples also.
